Here are short instructions on how to reproduce the work done on this project:

1) Import the dataset into Python using the following URL: "https://osf.io/7gvz9//download" (for that purpose, pre-install Pandas if do not have it already installed)

2) Perform the necessary coding work in Python (as shown in the "cars.ipynb" and "cars.py" files)

3) Export the derived dataset as .csv file 

4) Import the dataset derived from Python into Stata using the "import delimited ..." command (the command for reading 'comma-separated values' files into Stata).

5) Perform the necessary data processing and regression analysis in Stata. Export and save the output in the form of regression tables and graphs. 

6) There is a master do file as well (called masterfile.do) even though there are only three do-files in this smaller project. 

7) Please note that you need to run the do-file "install.do" only once in case you do not have the command 'mdesc' already installed in your version of Stata.
