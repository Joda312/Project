* please run this from the root folder of the project so that code can called be from code/...
* I decided to create a master do-file as well even though there are only three do-files in this project (as compared to a larger, pure Stata project)

* I use mdesc
* if you do not have it, uncomment and run the next code once
* do Stata/install

do Stata/data_processing
do Stata/regression_and_output
